# Bow Platformer
Local multiplayer platformer, which objective is to shoot an arrow and so, defeat the other player.
- Both players use the same keyboard:
  - Player 1 moves with WASD, jumps with space and shoots wih F.
  - Player 2 moves with arrow keys, jumps with Right CTRL and shoots with Right Shift.
* The platform is infinite, which means that if a player goes out of the bounds in either X or Y, it will reappear on the other side.
* Players have a double jump, allowing to go higher or further, also used to wall jump.
* Arrows will stick to the map, allowing players to grab them, and carry maximum 5.
- Different behaviours for the platforms, such as:
  - Moving
  - Rotating
  - Climbable (Wall Jump)
  - Non walkable (The top part of the climbable walls)
  - Floating (In the water section)
  - Pushable
  - Treadmill like (The emergent platform in the bottom left part)
