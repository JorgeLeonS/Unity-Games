# Escape Velocity
Endless runner based in space. Consists of a 2D game where random asteroids appear from the top of the screen. The player has three lives which decrease when it gets hit by an asteroid. The goal is to travel the longest distance.
 * When the player gets hit with more than one live remaining, a green explosion animation starts in the player's location and a sound is played.
 * When the player gets hit on it's last opportunity an orange explosion is shown, a different sound is played, the total distance is shown and a menu to try again or go back is diplayed.
 * The player movement and asteroids spawning area is restricted.
 * The velocity of the spaceship increases according to the traveled distance.
