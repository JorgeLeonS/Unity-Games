# GeometryGuars
This game mimics the basic gameplay of the Geometry Wars, published by Activision. The main objective is to shoot the spawning enemies to obtain the biggest score.
* Three types of enemies (slow, regular and fast) randomly spawned with Gizmos with a safe distance form player.
* Difficulty (enemy spawning speed) increases exponentially according to an animation curve.
* The glow in enemies, player, bullets and the pattern was applied through the default unity shaders.
* The player movement is controlled by the acceleration and turning speed.
* The bullets are spawned in a different roation depending on the clicked arrow.
